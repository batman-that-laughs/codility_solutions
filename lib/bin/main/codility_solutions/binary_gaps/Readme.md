## Problem Statement:


Given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

## Solution:
calculated the differnce between the consecutive indices of 1.
**Assumptions**
base index(or the initial index) set at base index + 1 so as to exclude it from the count.
